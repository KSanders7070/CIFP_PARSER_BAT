# CIFP_PARSER_BAT

Prior to running this batch, create a "PROJFOLDER" on your desktop to work in.

In that folder place the FAAIFP18 file in it and give it a .txt extension.

The CIFP appears to be extremely variable when it comes to the naming of their procedures.
One moment D=VOR/DME... the next it is LDA... the next it is NDB... Other times N is an NDB. The LDA/DME is sometimes called "LDA"

Then there are a ton of missing procedures from this data. For exmple: PHJR is missing the NDB RWY 4R data.
